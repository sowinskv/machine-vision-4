# Energy

spread forecasting and trading system for the Polish day-ahead electricity market.

predicts the SDAC–IDA1 price spread. trades only when conviction is high.

## 01 — Architecture

2 stages:

**01.1 — regression**
ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and Ridge.
estimates spread magnitude. models are weighted by out-of-fold MSE
(TimeSeriesSplit, 3 folds) — weights are based on held-out performance.

**01.2 — classification**
ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and Logistic Regression.
predicts probability that the spread is positive.
tree classifiers are wrapped in isotonic calibration so output probabilities
are reliable conviction signals, not raw overconfident scores.

**01.3 — synthesis**
final prediction combines both stages:

```
prediction = (2 × P(up) − 1) × |regression estimate|
```

sign comes from the classifier. magnitude from the regressor.
conviction determines position size. low-conviction hours are skipped.

## 03 — Features

all SDAC-derived features are shifted 24h.
at decision time, current-day prices are unknown — we only see yesterday.

**03.1 — market state** (lagged)
cross-border flows, system imbalance, activation capacity,
inter-market spreads (PL–DE, PL–SK), net position momentum.

**03.2 — price dynamics** (lagged)
SDAC lags (24h, 48h, 168h), rolling mean/std, EWMA, Bollinger width,
24h return, spread momentum, mean-reversion z-score.

**03.3 — fundamentals** (forward-looking, available pre-delivery)
demand forecast, PV/wind generation forecasts, residual load,
renewable share, gradients.

**03.4 — calendar**
hour, day-of-week, month (sin/cos encoded), weekend flag, peak hours.

## 05 — Configuration

everything lives in `config.yaml`.

model hyperparameters, ensemble composition, CV strategy,
trading parameters (conviction threshold, position limits, skip hours),
leakage column exclusions, and conformal interval settings.

---

## 06 — Validation

backtest across 4 expanding walk-forward folds. no lookahead, no overfitting.

```
pnl                   EUR      795
hit rate                       65.6%
sharpe                         11.43
sortino                        17.29
max drawdown          EUR     −379
hours traded                   19.9%
sharpe 95% ci         [  7.11, 13.31]
sharpe p-value                 0.000
```

note: numbers reflect the corrected pipeline (per-fold winsorization, OOF ensemble
weights, calibrated classifiers). pending reoptimization — hyperparameters were
tuned against the previous leaky pipeline and have not been re-searched yet.

**06.1 — why this is credible**

no current-day data.
every SDAC column is shifted 24h. the model only sees yesterday's
cleared prices and today's published forecasts.

no overfitting.
train R² is 0.05–0.07, test R² is ~0. the model doesn't memorize —
it barely fits the training set. the edge is directional, not magnitude.

temporal isolation.
expanding walk-forward CV with a 7-day purge gap before each test fold
and a 2-day embargo between folds. no information crosses the boundary.

statistical significance.
bootstrap Sharpe p-value = 0.000. the 95% confidence interval lower
bound (7.11) is well above zero. all 4 folds are independently profitable.

selectivity.
conviction threshold of 1.2 means the model trades only 19.9% of hours.
it stays out when uncertain.
